# AutoDelBinObj
Google Drive 'bin'/'obj' folder deleter

This project came to me Winter Quarter, 2017. One of my Comp Sci teachers, when we turned in our code, wanted us to delete the bin/obj folders because they takeup a lot of space, and are not necessary to run the programs (for C#). As I use my Google Drive for a code backup, I realized I could cut down a lot of storage space if I was able to delete those files.
So I created this script to automatically, every day, delete my bin/obj files from my selected folders.
